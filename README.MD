TITAN
=====

Theme: You Are the Monster
--------------------------

This is the theme I hoped would get chosen. Oh gosh.
Oh gosh.

This game will be a top-down, I guess what you'd call the very edge case of the beat-'em-up genre.

You play as a *titan*, a mythical, humongous humanoid creature, with a club. You're unleashed, by an army, as a WMD against a warring faction.

Your goal is to not die, and to cause as much destruction as possible. You can walk about, swing a club, all fun stuff.

Your enemies are swordsmen (if they're close, they're doing damage) and archers (you know what archers do I hope).

You have a, frankly, irresponsibly large health bar. It should be pretty hard to die in this game.

When you destroy the 'target' (a building), the mission is over. You gain points based on such levely things as
* slaughtering peasants
* widowing soldiers' wives
* destroying livelihoods
* demolishing nutrition sources
* eradicating enely culture

The point of the game I guess is to make you feel terrible about yourself? That's what I'm going for anyway.
